# Obsidian Chorded Hotkeys 
Use ðŸŽµ chords ðŸŽµ to trigger text replacement, template insertion, or command execution.

A chord is a set of keys pressed at the same time, the order doesn't matter! 

## Warning
Chorded Hotkeys works through text replacement, it is advised that you create a backup of your vault before installing this plugin.

## Usage 
You can add new chords from the Chored Hotkeys settings tab.

The current chord types are:
1. **Text:** Inserts text. '{c}' in replacement text represents cursor position.
2. **Command:** Runs a command.
3. **File:** Pastes the contents of a file.
4. **Template:** (Requires [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)) Pastes the contents of a template. Functionally equivalent to the file chord but also evaluates templates.
